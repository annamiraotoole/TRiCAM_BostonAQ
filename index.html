<h3 id="i-abstract">I. Abstract</h3>
<p>Air pollution is a significant concern for urban and suburban settings. The wide range of personal, industrial, and natural activities that take place in an urban space each contribute to the air pollution in their own way. Several key pollutants are released in varying concentrations and, though chemically and physically diverse, all pose significant health concerns for residents in urban centers.</p>

<p>This project will be conducted through widespread collection of data, application of advanced statistical models, and computational mathematics techniques. Our end goal is to create an interface that will both enhance the quality of urban life in Boston and be accessible to all people, regardless of academic background.  The acquisition of data for this project will span various sources in the greater Boston area that pertain to air quality and its intersection with urban living, primarily transportation, land use, and weather, in addition to data on the air pollutants themselves.</p>

<p>Our plan for our final deliverable is an accessible demonstration of the results of this rigorous modeling that can help city residents make more informed decisions on how to live a cleaner life, with a particular emphasis on aiding people potentially more vulnerable to air pollution, such as people with respiratory illnesses or allergies, pedestrians, and cyclists.</p>

<p><a name="Intro"></a></p>
<h3 id="ii-intro">II. Intro</h3>
<p>Air pollution data, particularly in the city of Boston, is increasingly important to analyze in health and environmental settings. Our sponsors informed us that the pollutants Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), and Fine Particulate Matter (PM₂.₅ ) are the most detrimental to human health. Therefore, we have collected and will continue to collect data on these compounds.</p>

<p>While pollutants have serious impacts on the environmen - for example, Sulfur Dioxide contributes to acid rain - we are focusing on the human health impacts. Sulfur Dioxide comes from multiple sources such as power plants and has been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory issues. Nitrogen Dioxide, whose source is primarily combustion, affects the respiratory systems and is also an indicator of other carcinogenic chemicals that are not widely measured. Fine Particulate Matter contributes to increased cortisone levels and hormone irregularities. In addition, Fine Particulate Matter, which comes upwind from the midwest and is produced by local combustion, is one of the most damaging pollutants as the small particle size allows the particles to enter the alveolar sacs of the lungs and enter the bloodstream directly [1]. The Environmental Protection Agency sets standard levels for each of these pollutants that are deemed acceptable for public health. We are using these standards as a baseline for our model.</p>

<p>There are currently only 5 sensors in Boston collecting data on air quality. Due to this limited amount of data, we would like to simulate more data from our collection data on air quality, which is a similar approach to the data simulation methods implemented in the Zurich study [2]. We also plan to utilize data on Boston transit routes, land use, traffic, green spaces, bike lanes, and weather in our model.</p>

<p>In addition, we have been inspired by scientists who completed studies on air pollution in an effort to understand and utilize the things that contribute to poor air quality in urban settings [3]. In the end, our interface would serve both as an educational tool for the public and as a tool for scientists to better visualize pollution. </p>

<p><a name="Problem"></a></p>
<h3 id="iii-problem-statement-and-methods">III. Problem Statement and Methods</h3>
<p>One of our most obvious problems is Boston’s lack of air quality data. Boston only has five sensor stations, each of which collects different numbers and types of air pollutants. To develop an accurate model, we must infer and simulate based on other data sources. Our main goals are to mine more data on the concentration of NO₂, PM₂.₅ and SO₂ in Boston’s air throughout the course of a day, and to optimize the placement of a new sensor using statistical air quality models.</p>

<p>For building our statistical models, we will gather, clean and merge other data on transportation, weather and land use patterns. Our intended sources of this data can be found in our Data Sources section. We expect that many of these data sources will not be easily accessible, as we already know some have rate limits, outdated or nonexistent APIs and strange formatting.</p>

<p>Our goal for our final deliverable is to identify “danger spots” for those with health concerns such as asthma, COPD and allergies. By using both Gaussian Processes and neural networks, we hope to accurately predict the levels of criteria pollutants in Boston and the surrounding areas. We expect that adapting existing air quality models to fit this goals will be a major challenge as there are a large number of variable to be accounted for. We must also take into account common pitfalls like accuracy, model overfitting, and visualization of high dimensional spaces.</p>

<p><a name="Deliverables"></a></p>
<h3 id="iv-deliverables">IV. Deliverables</h3>
<p>The goal of our midterm deliverable consist of two parts. One is to implement a baseline statistical model of Boston’s air quality. The other is a proof of concept web interface for a Boston pollution tracker. After week 6, we will work to implement an improved neural network model for our web interface as well as improve the design and usability. In our first week at Harvard, we have brainstormed several additional ambitious ideas. If time permits, we would like to use our air quality simulations to provide urban planning tools for Boston policymakers. Ideally, the models we create would be compatible with and useful to other cities around the world.</p>
